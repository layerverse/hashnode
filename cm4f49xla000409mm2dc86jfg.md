Kira was gazing at the view of the city by the window, resting a side of his head on the glass.

Kira was a demon, with light blue skin and magenta hair, and had a few black earrings on his ears.

It was night, and the city was glaring with cyan and pink lights.

In the distance, the Mia Tower was visible, with its blocky heart glowing with a bright magenta light.

He put on music in his head, through his Eternal Interface － which most people call as Eternity or their Eternity. Texts displaying the name of the current song and the playlist title, and a 3D cover image that represents the playlist showed up in the air near Kira, and faded out after a moment.

The playlist title was Neo City Pop. The genre was a combination of modern Utopian music and a retro Orien music genre called city pop. The genre was universally popular, but it was especially loved in Mia, and many creators in Mia created neo city pop music, and Kira was one of them.

Kira was a singer songwriter. He used his Eternity to compose his songs, write lyrics, and sang them by himself.

The music started playing in his head, and the sound of neo city pop saturated the sight of the night city.

Vehicles were flying around, both near the window and in the distance, forming the lines of traffic in the air. Around the Mia Tower had an air roundabout shaped as a hexagon, multi-layered and being a pivot point of providing access to different sections of the city.

Near the window was a street, that was relatively busy. The vehicles were flowing in both directions, enough to create the lines of traffic almost without a break.

The low buzzing of the traffic gave him the sense of being in the city. Even though the vehicles in Mia, as well as most vehicles powered by layer magic, didn’t make loud noises but only had moderate sounds as a vehicle presence indicator for safety.

The night sight of Mia generally looked light blue, with lime lights, or cyan or teal in some places, with accents of pink lights here and there, and the light workings of Mia made it so that the shadows were purple-ish.

Kira mindlessly admired the view, and eventually, the pleasant sounds of the music invited him into sleep, making him to doze off.

The Eternal users, or the Eternalists, didn’t require sleep, but he was one of the materialists who preferred to have sleep, for the sensation of it.

He made his mind to take the invitation of sleep. He tuned out of the music in his mind and parted from the window, approaching the bed and slid himself into the bed.

The night city of Mia had no sleep. Tonight was no exception, and the night life of the city continued on, but with just one less admirer.
